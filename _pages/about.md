I am a lecturer of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. My current research interests lie in neural networks, swarm intelligence, fitness landscape analysis, time-series analysis, high-dimensional optimisation, and deep learning. I am interested in developing a better fundamental understanding of how and why neural networks function. I also love seeing machine learning in action, thus I have a strong interest in real-life applications.

If you are interested in postgraduate studies under my supervision, contact me via e-mail: annar_AT_cs.up.ac.za.
