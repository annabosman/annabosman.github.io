I am a senior lecturer of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria. I have been researching artificial neural networks since 2007, and completed my PhD in 2019, with a focus on developing a better fundamental understanding of the high-dimensional search spaces of the neural network parameters. I lead the [Computational Intelligence Research Group (CIRG)](https://cirg.cs.up.ac.za/) at the University of Pretoria. You can find the most up-to-date list of my publications on my [Google scholar page](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=nGQ-E9kAAAAJ&hl=en).

My current research interests lie in developing a better fundamental understanding of artificial neural networks as optimisation problems, as well as practical and sustainable applications of the deep learning techniques. I believe that we need models that are smarter rather than larger. As such, my current research focuses on developing novel neural models that are energy-efficient, intelligent compression techniques for large neural models, as well as fundamental research on the loss landscape properties of neural networks. I believe that practitioners waste too much time fine-tuning their models, as such I also do research on automating this tedious task via neural architecture search and meta-learning. I love seeing machine learning in action, thus I am always keen to try my hand at real-life applications. Specifically, I dabble in computer vision, ranging from change detection and low-light image enhancement to biomedical, agricultural, and astronomical image analysis.

If you are interested in postgraduate studies under my supervision, you may contact me via e-mail: anna.bosman_AT_up.ac.za. Please remember to include your CV and full academic transcript. Are you looking for a research topic? Great, I have plenty of ideas waiting to be investigated. Do you have your own topic that matches my research interests? Excellent, we can brainstorm together to turn it into a research project.
